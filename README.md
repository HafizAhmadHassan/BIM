## TBSS to study Fabry disease
Apply the [Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811906001388) technique to investigate a group of subjects affected by the [Fabry disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabry_disease). TBSS is implemented in the FSL toolbox and, as a guidance, you can follow this [tutorial](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/TBSS/UserGuide).
The goal is to study whether the Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) technique is able to differentiate the two groups of subjects (patients vs controls).



NB: you are expected to write a short report (in English, max 10 pages) which should describe the algorithms and the techniques you used, the implementation choices you made as well a discussion of the results you obtained. You will have 10'-15' to present your work in front of our research group (in English), followed by a 10'-15' discussion.
